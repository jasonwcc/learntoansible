options:
  headers:
    description: Additional headers.
    type: dict
  deviceType:
    description:
      - >
        DeviceType query parameter. These are the device families supported for health score definitions. If no
        input is made on device family, all device families are considered.
    type: str
  id:
    description:
      - >
        Id query parameter. The definition identifier. Examples id=015d9cba-4f53-4087-8317-7e49e5ffef46 (single
        entity id request) id=015d9cba-4f53-4087-8317-7e49e5ffef46&id=015d9cba-4f53-4087-8317-7e49e5ffef47
        (multiple ids in the query param).
    type: str
  includeForOverallHealth:

      - >
        IncludeForOverallHealth query parameter. The inclusion status of the issue definition, either true or
        false. True indicates that particular health metric is included in overall health computation, otherwise
        false. By default it's set to true.
    type: bool

    description:
      - >
        Attribute query parameter. These are the attributes supported in health score definitions response. By
        default, all properties are sent in response.
    type: str
  offset:
    description:
      - >
        Offset query parameter. Specifies the starting point within all records returned by the API. It's one
