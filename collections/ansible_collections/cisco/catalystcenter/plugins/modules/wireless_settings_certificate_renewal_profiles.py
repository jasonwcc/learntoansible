          schedulerDate:
            description: Dates in a month (1 to 31) on which execution is scheduled. If the specified date does not exist
              in that month, no execution will be triggered for that date. For example, on the dates 1, 10, 30 in February,
              execution would occur only on dates 1 and 10.

            description: End time on the wireless controller at which the scheduler should stop any execution. Format HH MM
              in 24-hour notation. Example 23 59.

      schedulerType:
        description: Type of scheduler (e.g., DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY) * DAILY schedule requires a schedulerStartTime input
          and an optional schedulerEndTime in the duration. * WEEKLY schedule requires schedulerDay input in the duration
          along with a schedulerStartTime input and an optional schedulerEndTime in the duration. * MONTHLY schedule requires
          schedulerDate input in the duration along with a schedulerStartTime input and an optional schedulerEndTime in the
          duration.

  lscProfileName:
    description: Name of the LSC profile.
    type: str
  renewalDueInDays:
    description: Type of renewal (e.g., ONESHOT, STAGGERED) * STAGGERED execution when configured with calendarProfileSetting
      requires both start time and end time input from scheduler. STAGGERED execution also requires a percentage input which
      specifies the percentage of access points that can be considered for certificate renewal per iteration. * ONESHOT execution
      when configured with calendarProfileSetting requires a start time input. ONESHOT execution does not need percentage
      input as all the access points certificate renewal happens at oneshot.
