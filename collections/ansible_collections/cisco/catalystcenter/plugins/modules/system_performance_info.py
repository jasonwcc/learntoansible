  - Get all System Performance. - > Retrieves the average values of cluster key performance indicators KPIs , such as CPU
    utilization, memory utilization or network rates over the past 15 minutes. Query parameters 'function', 'startTime' and
    'endTime' are no longer supported.

        Function query parameter. In this release this field has been deprecated and no longer supported.
        Previously supported functions were 'sum', 'average', and 'max'. Now, only the last 15 minutes average
        of cluster key performance indicators (KPIs) is returned, regardless of the specified function. For
        example, if 'sum', 'average', or 'max' is provided, it will be ignored and the 'average' of the last 15
        minutes will be returned.

        StartTime query parameter. In this release this field has been deprecated and no longer supported. Only
        the last 15 minutes average of cluster key performance indicators (KPIs) is returned, regardless of the
        provided epoch time. For example, if any epoch time is specified for this field, it will be ignored and
        15 minutes before the current time will be considered.

        the last 15 minutes average of cluster key performance indicators (KPIs) is returned, regardless of the
        provided epoch time. For example, if any epoch time is specified for this field, it will be ignored and
        the current time will be considered.
