module: fabrics_fabric_id_switch_wireless_setting_reload
short_description: Resource module for Fabrics Fabric Id Switch Wireless Setting Reload
description:
  - Manage operation create of the resource Fabrics Fabric Id Switch Wireless Setting Reload. - > This API is used to reload
    switches after disabling wireless to remove the wireless-controller configuration on the device. When wireless is disabled
    on a switch, all wireless configurations are removed except for the wireless-controller configuration. To completely remove
    the wireless-controller configuration, you can use this API. Please note that using this API will cause a reload of the
    devices. This API should only be used for devices that have wireless disabled but still have the 'wireless-controller'
    configuration present. The reload payload can have a maximum of two switches as only two switches can have a wireless
    role in a fabric site.
