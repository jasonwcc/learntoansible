description:
  - Get all Network Device Images.
  - Get Network Device Images by id. - > The API retrieves information about running images and golden image bundle, if they
    are available for the network device. It also provides network device update status and image update status related to
    the golden image bundle and the compatible features supported by the network device. Network device with `networkDeviceImageStatus`
    set as `OUTDATED` is considered ready for update based on the golden image bundle. - > This API retrieves information
