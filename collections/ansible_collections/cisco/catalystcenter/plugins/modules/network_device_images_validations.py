short_description: Resource module for Network Device Images Validations
description:
  - Manage operations create, update and delete of the resource Network Device Images Validations. - > Custom network device
    validation refers to the tailored process of verifying and assessing the configurations of network devices based on specific
    organizational requirements and unique network environments. Unlike standard validations, custom network device validations
    are designed to address the distinctive needs and challenges of a particular network infrastructure, ensuring that devices
    operate optimally within the defined parameters. Upon task completion, the task API response's `resultLocation` attribute
    will provide the URL to retrieve the validation id.
  - Delete the custom network device validation.
  - Update the custom network device validation details.
